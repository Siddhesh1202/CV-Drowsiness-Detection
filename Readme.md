# Drowsiness Detection System

This project is a prototype of a Drowsiness Detection System designed to detect signs of driver drowsiness using real-time video input and computer vision techniques. The system monitors the driverâ€™s facial landmarks to detect eye closure and yawning, alerting the driver with a warning sound when signs of drowsiness are detected. The system also includes a performance evaluation using an ROC curve.

## Features

- **Real-time Drowsiness Detection**: Tracks eye closure and yawning to identify drowsiness.
- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Uses **dlib** to detect and track facial landmarks for eye and mouth movement monitoring.
- **Alert Mechanism**: Plays an alert sound through **VLC** when signs of drowsiness are detected.
- **ROC Curve Analysis**: Provides an evaluation metric to assess the model's accuracy using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
